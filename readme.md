# Therapy Bot with Empathetic Tone
## Description:
This project builds a supportive, non-judgmental chatbot designed to simulate a virtual therapy session. The bot listens, responds with empathy, and encourages self-reflection. It doesn’t provide clinical advice but acts as a kind listener using an empathetic prompt style. Perfect for practicing tone, prompt design, and emotional intelligence in LLMs.

# Implementation
We’ll use OpenAI + Gradio to create a warm, comforting conversation flow.
